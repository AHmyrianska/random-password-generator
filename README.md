# Random Password Generator
This is a simple password generator implemented using JavaScript, which allows you to generate passwords consisting of digits only, characters only, or a combination of both.

## Usage
Clone the repository or download the ZIP file and extract its contents.
Open the index.html file in your preferred web browser.

## Features

Password Types: Choose from the following options:
Digits Only: Generate a password consisting of digits only.
Characters Only: Generate a password consisting of characters only.
Digits and Characters: Generate a password consisting of both digits and characters.
Dual Passwords: The generator will always generate two passwords based on your selection, allowing you to choose the one that suits you best. This makes it convenient to compare and select a password without regenerating multiple times.
